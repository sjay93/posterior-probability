Code structure: Taking the input as argument then we compute the number of Cherry and Lime in the input and then we compute the posterior probability of different hypotheses given priors for these hypotheses, and given a sequence of observations. After this we compute the probability that the next observation will be of a specific type, priors for different hypotheses, and given a sequence of observations. We print the output in results.txt file.
